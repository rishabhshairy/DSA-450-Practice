1. Recursion: each function calls give rise to 2 more: therefore O(2^n)
2. Memoization: stores in an array: O(n) -->
                Sub-problem results are stored in an array, ensuring that each sub-problem is solved only once.
3. Tabulation: iterative approach and takes O(n) sub-problems from the smallest to the largest.

RECURSION: Top down: We start from answer, go to the base case and then go back

MEMOIZATION: TOP DOWN:  avoids redundant calls done in recursion reducing time complexity

TABULATION IS: Bottom up: We start from the base case, and we try to go to the required answer
