Dijkstra : from a single source, find shortest paths to all nodes.

Floyd-Warshall : shortest path from every node as a source.

Bellman-Ford : same as Dijkstra, but works for negative weights.

Topological Sort : print the nodes with no incoming edges first.

MST : connect all the nodes with minimum costs (n nodes // n-1 edges).

Prim's Algo : build the MST by starting from any node and expanding the tree one edge at a time.

Kruskal Algo : build the MST by sorting all edges and adding them one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed.
